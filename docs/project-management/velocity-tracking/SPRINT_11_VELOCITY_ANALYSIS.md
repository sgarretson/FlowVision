# üìä Sprint 11: Velocity Analysis & Capacity Planning

## üéØ **SPRINT 11 METRICS OVERVIEW**

### **Sprint Details**

- **Sprint Number**: 11
- **Duration**: 2 weeks (August 13-27, 2025)
- **Focus**: Naming Conventions & Code Quality Optimization
- **Team Size**: 4 developers + 1 part-time specialist

---

## üìà **VELOCITY BASELINE**

### **Historical Velocity (Last 3 Sprints)**

```
Sprint 8:  ~28 story points delivered (UI/Mobile focus)
Sprint 9:  ~34 story points delivered (Testing & QA)
Sprint 10: ~34 story points delivered (Production deployment)

Average Velocity: 32 story points per sprint
Velocity Range: 28-34 story points
Consistency Index: High (¬±3 point variance)
```

### **Team Capacity Analysis**

```
Senior Developer 1:    8 points/week = 16 points/sprint
Senior Developer 2:    8 points/week = 16 points/sprint
Documentation Lead:    4 points/week = 8 points/sprint
QA Engineer:          4 points/week = 8 points/sprint
Project Manager:      2 points/week = 4 points/sprint (part-time)

Total Theoretical Capacity: 52 points/sprint
Effective Capacity (80%):   42 points/sprint
Conservative Estimate:      32 points/sprint
```

## üîç **SPRINT 11 CAPACITY PLANNING**

### **Planned Story Points**

```
Story 11.1: Naming Convention Refactoring     = 8 points
Story 11.2: Code Quality Standards           = 3 points
Story 11.3: GitHub Cleanup & Organization    = 2 points
Total Planned:                               = 13 points
Buffer (10%):                                = 1.3 points
Total with Buffer:                           = 14.3 points
```

### **Capacity Utilization**

```
Planned Capacity: 13 story points
Historical Average: 32 story points
Utilization Rate: 41% (Conservative approach)

Reasoning for Conservative Planning:
- Refactoring work has hidden complexity
- Cross-codebase changes require careful validation
- Quality focus over velocity optimization
- Technical debt reduction priority
```

## üìä **VELOCITY PREDICTION MODELS**

### **Optimistic Scenario (90% confidence)**

```
All stories completed as planned: 13 points
Additional ad-hoc improvements: 2-3 points
Total Delivered: 15-16 points
Timeline: Complete by Day 10 of sprint
```

### **Realistic Scenario (70% confidence)**

```
Core refactoring completed: 8 points
Documentation completed: 3 points
GitHub cleanup completed: 2 points
Total Delivered: 13 points (100% of planned)
Timeline: Complete by Day 12 of sprint
```

### **Pessimistic Scenario (95% confidence)**

```
Refactoring with complications: 6-7 points
Documentation partially complete: 2 points
GitHub cleanup: 2 points
Total Delivered: 10-11 points (77-85% of planned)
Timeline: Extends into final days
```

## üîÑ **CAPACITY ADJUSTMENT FACTORS**

### **Sprint-Specific Considerations**

**Positive Factors** (+velocity):

- Clear, well-defined scope
- Strong team expertise in refactoring
- Good tooling support (IDE, TypeScript)
- No external dependencies
- High motivation for code quality

**Risk Factors** (-velocity):

- Cross-codebase impact requires careful coordination
- Potential for discovering additional naming issues
- Testing validation may reveal unexpected issues
- August vacation period (potential team availability)

**Net Adjustment**: Neutral to slightly positive

### **Team Availability**

```
Week 1 (Aug 13-17): 100% team availability
Week 2 (Aug 20-24): 90% availability (vacation considerations)
Week 3 (Aug 25-27): 100% availability

Effective Sprint Capacity: 95% of planned
Adjusted Target: 12.4 story points (rounded to 12)
```
