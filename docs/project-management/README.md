- **Retrospective**: End of each sprint (1 hour)

### Story Point Estimation

- **1 point**: Simple bug fix or minor enhancement
- **3 points**: Small feature or moderate task
- **5 points**: Medium feature requiring design
- **8 points**: Complex feature with multiple components
- **13 points**: Large feature requiring architecture changes

### Definition of Done
