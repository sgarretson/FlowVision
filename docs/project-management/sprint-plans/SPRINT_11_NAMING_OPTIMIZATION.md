## üèóÔ∏è **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: File Structure Refactoring** (Day 1-3)

```bash
# Critical renames
lib/enhanced-rbac.ts ‚Üí lib/access-control.ts
lib/optimized-openai-service.ts ‚Üí lib/ai-service.ts
```

### **Phase 2: Type System Updates** (Day 4-6)

```typescript
// Type renames
EnhancedPermission ‚Üí Permission
EnhancedRole ‚Üí Role
EnhancedUser ‚Üí AuthenticatedUser
OptimizedOpenAIService ‚Üí AIService
OptimizedAIConfig ‚Üí AIServiceConfig
```

### **Phase 3: Import/Export Migration** (Day 7-9)

```typescript
// Update all references
import { AuthenticatedUser } from '@/lib/access-control';
import { AIService } from '@/lib/ai-service';
```

### **Phase 4: Testing & Validation** (Day 10-12)

```bash
npm run lint    # TypeScript & code quality
npm test        # Unit tests
npm run build   # Production build
```

## üìä **CAPACITY PLANNING**

### **Team Assignment**

- **Senior Developer 1**: Lead refactoring implementation (5 points)
- **Senior Developer 2**: Import/export updates and testing (3 points)
- **Documentation Specialist**: Standards documentation (2 points)
- **QA Engineer**: Validation and testing (1 point)

### **Sprint Capacity**: 13 story points

**Buffer**: 2 points for unexpected issues
**Total Planned**: 11 story points

## üö® **RISK MANAGEMENT**

### **Identified Risks**

1. **Breaking Changes**: Refactoring may break existing functionality
2. **Missing References**: Some import/export references might be missed
3. **Type Conflicts**: TypeScript compilation issues during migration

### **Mitigation Strategies**

1. **Gradual Migration**: Keep old files until all references updated
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Run full test suite after each phase
3. **IDE Tools**: Use find/replace and refactoring tools
4. **Backup Strategy**: Git commits after each major phase
