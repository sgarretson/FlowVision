## ðŸŽ¯ QA Framework

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Component and function-level testing with Jest
- **Integration Testing**: API and service integration validation
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete user journey testing with Cypress
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing and performance benchmarks
- **Security Testing**: Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing
- **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification

### Quality Standards

- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage requirement
- **Performance Targets**: Page load times under 2 seconds
- **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Security Standards**: OWASP Top 10 compliance
- **Browser Compatibility**: Support for modern browsers
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Responsive design across devices

### Quality Gates

## ðŸ”„ Testing Process

### Automated Testing

1. **Unit Tests**: Run on every commit
2. **Integration Tests**: Execute in CI/CD pipeline
3. **E2E Tests**: Automated user journey validation
4. **Performance Tests**: Regular performance benchmarking
5. **Security Scans**: Automated vulnerability detection

### Manual Testing

1. **Exploratory Testing**: Ad-hoc testing for edge cases
2. **Usability Testing**: User experience validation
3. **Accessibility Testing**: Manual accessibility verification
4. **Cross-browser Testing**: Compatibility across browsers
5. **Mobile Testing**: Responsive design validation

### Quality Metrics

- **Defect Rate**: Bugs per feature or release
- **Test Execution Rate**: Percentage of tests executed
- **Test Pass Rate**: Percentage of tests passing
- **Coverage Rate**: Code coverage percentage
- **Performance Metrics**: Load times and responsiveness
