- ‚úÖ **Consistent micro-interactions** across all components
- ‚úÖ **Modern visual effects** with glassmorphism and subtle animations
- ‚úÖ **Enterprise-grade appearance** suitable for A&E firms

### **Design Tokens Established**

#### **Card Hierarchy**:

```css
.card-subtle     /* Light shadow for secondary content */
.card-standard   /* Standard shadow for primary content */
.card-elevated   /* Enhanced shadow for important/interactive content */
.card-interactive /* Hover effects with translateY and shadow enhancement */
```

#### **Semantic Color System**:

- **Blue**: Primary actions and initiatives
- **Green**: Completed states and success metrics
- **Orange**: In-progress states and warnings
- **Red**: Critical issues and overdue items

- **Indigo**: Resources and secondary metrics

#### **Animation Principles**:

- **Hover States**: `translateY(-1px)` with enhanced shadow
- **Active States**: `translateY(0)` with reduced timing
- **Drag States**: `rotate(2deg) scale(1.05)` with elevated shadow
- **Loading States**: Smooth skeleton animations with shimmer
