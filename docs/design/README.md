## üé® Design System Overview

### Core Design Principles

1. **Consistency First** - Unified visual language across all interfaces
2. **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all components
3. **Scalability** - Design tokens and systems that grow with the product
4. **User-Centered** - Design decisions based on user research and feedback
5. **Performance** - Optimized designs for fast loading and smooth interactions

### Design Tokens

- **Colors**: Primary, secondary, semantic color palettes
- **Typography**: Font families, sizes, weights, and line heights
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing scale for layouts
- **Shadows**: Elevation system for depth and hierarchy
- **Borders**: Border radius and stroke specifications

### Component Library

- **Basic Components**: Buttons, inputs, cards, modals
- **Complex Components**: Data tables, charts, navigation
- **Layout Components**: Grids, containers, spacing utilities
- **Feedback Components**: Alerts, toasts, loading states
