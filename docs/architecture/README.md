## üéØ Architecture Principles

### Core Principles

1. **Modular Design** - Loosely coupled, highly cohesive components
2. **Security First** - Security considerations in every design decision
3. **Performance Focused** - Optimized for speed and efficiency
4. **Scalable Foundation** - Built to grow with business needs
5. **AI-Native** - AI capabilities integrated at the core

### Technology Standards

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with JWT
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT integration with caching
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with design tokens

### Quality Gates

- Type safety with TypeScript strict mode
- Component isolation and reusability
- Database query optimization
- Security middleware on all routes
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance monitoring and alerts
