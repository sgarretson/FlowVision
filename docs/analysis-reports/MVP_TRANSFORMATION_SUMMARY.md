## üéì LESSONS LEARNED & APPLIED

### **AI Development Best Practices**

1. **Never hardcode secrets** - Use environment variables
2. **Implement caching early** - AI operations are expensive
3. **Plan for failures** - AI services can be unreliable
4. **Monitor costs** - AI usage can scale quickly
5. **Optimize prompts** - Small changes = big savings

### **Security-First Development**

1. **Validate everything** - Input, environment, configuration
2. **Assume breach** - Implement defense in depth
3. **Log everything** - Audit trails are critical
4. **Test security** - Automate security validation
5. **Monitor continuously** - Security is ongoing

### **Quality Assurance**

1. **Automate testing** - Manual testing doesn't scale
2. **Test early** - Fix bugs when they're cheap
3. **Test everything** - Security, performance, functionality
4. **Monitor production** - Testing never ends
5. **Learn continuously** - Improve based on data
