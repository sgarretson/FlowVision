## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools & Standards

### Required Tools

- **Node.js** 18+ with npm
- **PostgreSQL** 14+ for database
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Git** with conventional commit standards
- **VSCode/Cursor** with recommended extensions

### Development Workflow

1. **Setup**: Follow [Team Onboarding Guide](./TEAM_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md)
2. **Development**: Use [GitHub Best Practices](./GITHUB_BEST_PRACTICES.md)
3. **Testing**: Run comprehensive test suite before commits
4. **Deployment**: Follow [Deployment Guide](./DEPLOYMENT.md)
5. **Monitoring**: Use [Advanced Logging](./ADVANCED_LOGGING.md) for debugging

### Code Quality Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with full type coverage
- **ESLint**: Zero errors or warnings allowed
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting
- **Jest**: 80%+ test coverage requirement
- **Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Naming Conventions**: Professional, functional naming (no subjective qualifiers)

### Naming Convention Standards

- **NEVER use subjective qualifiers**: enhanced, optimized, improved, advanced, better, new, custom, special
- **ALWAYS use functional descriptors**: service, manager, handler, engine, processor, validator, factory
- **ALWAYS use domain-driven naming**: `{domain}-{function}.ts` (e.g., `ai-service.ts`, `user-authentication.ts`)
- **ALWAYS name for what code does**, not how well it does it
- **ALWAYS use clear, descriptive names** that remain relevant as system evolves
- **ALWAYS follow patterns**: Class names should be `NounFunction` (e.g., `UserService`, `DataValidator`)
- **ALWAYS use consistent casing**: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for types/classes, camelCase for variables/functions

## üîÑ Development Process

### Daily Workflow

1. **Start**: Pull latest changes from main branch
2. **Branch**: Create feature branch with descriptive name
3. **Develop**: Write code following established standards
4. **Test**: Run tests locally and ensure they pass
5. **Commit**: Use conventional commit messages
6. **Push**: Push to feature branch and create PR
7. **Review**: Address feedback and merge when approved

### Quality Gates

- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier checks pass
- [ ] Security scan shows no high/critical issues
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Documentation updated for new features
- [ ] Naming conventions followed (no subjective qualifiers)
- [ ] Code review checklist completed

### Environment Management

- **Development**: Local environment with hot reload
- **Staging**: Production-like environment for testing
- **Production**: Live environment with monitoring
- **Testing**: Isolated environment for automated tests

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Development Environment

- **Node version issues**: Use `.nvmrc` file for version consistency
- **Database connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and configured
- **Port conflicts**: Check for conflicting services on development ports
- **Module resolution**: Clear `node_modules` and reinstall if needed

### Git Workflow

- **Merge conflicts**: Use `git rebase main` to resolve conflicts
- **Commit messages**: Follow conventional commit format
- **Branch naming**: Use `feature/`, `fix/`, or `chore/` prefixes
- **Pull requests**: Include descriptive title and test instructions

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **Build failures**: Check logs in GitHub Actions for details
- **Test failures**: Run tests locally to reproduce and fix
- **Deployment issues**: Verify environment variables and configuration
- **Performance issues**: Review monitoring logs and metrics
