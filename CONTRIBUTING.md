## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/feature-name` - New features
- `fix/bug-description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/documentation-update` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/component-name` - Code refactoring
- `test/test-description` - Test additions or updates

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

```
feat(auth): add user registration with email verification
fix(dashboard): resolve initiative loading performance issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow our coding standards
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**

   npm test
   npm run lint
   npm run type-check
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(component): add new feature"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Use our PR template
   - Provide clear description of changes
   - Link related issues
   - Request review from maintainers

## üìã Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types and interfaces
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Use strict mode settings

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow naming conventions: PascalCase for components
- Use descriptive prop names
- Implement proper error boundaries

### Database

- Use Prisma for all database operations
- Create migrations for schema changes
- Include proper relationships and constraints
- Add database seeds for testing

### API Routes

- Implement proper error handling
- Use Zod for input validation
- Include audit logging for data changes
- Follow RESTful conventions

### Testing

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Test React components with Testing Library
- Create integration tests for API routes
- Maintain 80%+ test coverage

### File Organization

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/              # Next.js app directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/       # Reusable UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/             # Utility functions and configurations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/           # TypeScript type definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/           # Test files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prisma/          # Database schema and migrations
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Test individual functions and components
- Mock external dependencies
- Use descriptive test names
- Cover edge cases and error conditions

```typescript
describe('calculatePriority', () => {
  it('should return high priority for critical issues', () => {
    const result = calculatePriority({ severity: 'critical', impact: 'high' });
    expect(result).toBe('high');
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

- Test API endpoints
- Test database operations
- Use test database
- Clean up after tests

### E2E Tests

- Test complete user workflows
- Use Cypress for browser testing
- Test critical user paths
- Maintain stable test data

## üìö Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Use JSDoc for function documentation
- Include type information
- Provide usage examples
- Document complex algorithms

### README Updates

- Keep installation instructions current
- Update feature lists
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Maintain API documentation
