## üìã PHASE 1: ISSUE IDENTIFICATION & REPORTING

**Lead:** Sarah Chen (COO)

### Test Steps:

1. **Navigate to Issues page** (`/issues`)
2. **Click "üìù Individual Issues" tab** (should be default)
3. **Report new issue** using this realistic scenario:

```
Issue Description (copy/paste):
Client communication gaps are causing project delays and rework. Clients frequently request status updates via email/phone, creating 15+ interruptions daily for project managers. This leads to 3-4 hour weekly overhead per PM, and clients still feel uninformed about project progress. Additionally, design change requests often come through informal channels (text, phone calls) without proper documentation, leading to scope creep and billing disputes.
```

### Expert Evaluation Points:

- ‚úÖ **Form usability:** Is the issue reporting form intuitive?
- ‚úÖ **Auto-scoring:** Does the heatmap score seem reasonable (expect 80-90)?
- ‚úÖ **Immediate feedback:** Are you informed the issue was created successfully?
- ‚úÖ **Voting mechanism:** Can you vote on the issue after creation?

### Expected Results:

- Issue appears in the list with high heatmap score
- Department auto-detected as "Project Management"
- Category assigned as "communication"
- Voting buttons functional
