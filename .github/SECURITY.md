## Reporting a Vulnerability

The FlowVision team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@flowvision.app**

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

- We will respond to your report within 48 hours
- We will provide an estimated timeline for addressing the vulnerability
- We will notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed
- We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Measures

FlowVision implements several security measures to protect user data and system integrity:

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Supported for admin accounts
- **Role-based Access Control**: Granular permissions system
- **Session Management**: Secure JWT tokens with expiration
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with strong policies

### Data Protection

- **Encryption in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Prisma ORM with parameterized queries
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy headers

### Infrastructure Security

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security audits of npm packages
- **Container Security**: Docker images scanned for vulnerabilities
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate staging and production environments
- **Backup Encryption**: Encrypted database backups

### Monitoring & Logging

- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of user actions
- **Security Events**: Monitoring for suspicious activities
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak information
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing to FlowVision, please follow these security guidelines:

### Code Security

- Never commit secrets, API keys, or passwords to the repository
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Follow the principle of least privilege for database access
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

### Dependency Management

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review security advisories for installed packages
- Use `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
- Consider using `npm audit fix` to automatically update vulnerable packages

### Testing

- Include security testing in your test suites
- Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Validate error handling doesn't expose sensitive information
- Test authentication and authorization flows
